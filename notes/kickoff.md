# Kick-off notes
The focus of the project is on predicting residential burglaries in London by analyzing patterns in past crimes. The project aims to provide accurate forecasts and long-term analyses while taking into account the limitations of police resources.

The MET police is the largest police force in the UK, with 33k officers and 12k support staff. However, there is a shortage of detectives to solve burglary cases, with too few detectives per case load, particularly in areas such as Barnett, which has a high volume of burglaries (200-300 a month).

The project aims to reduce the volume of burglaries and allocate police resources effectively. Good projects should provide forecasts as tightly as possible and use literature on what works in crime reduction. Special operations are only available three times per year, so it is essential to justify why and how they are necessary.

The project takes into account ethical considerations, and the data on crimes is anonymized to protect minorities, with the exact location slightly anonymized. Supporting data, such as probation data, is available for use, but ethical considerations should be kept in mind.

The winning team may have their findings implemented by the police. A detective head for burglary will give a detailed explanation of the tactical challenges in catching burglars.

The notes also mention that theft with trespass (burglary) is challenging to solve as it is almost always a reactive investigation. Catching burglars in the act is often down to luck or requires time-consuming surveillance.

The project considers the impact of COVID-19 on crime, with the pandemic causing everyone to stay at home more. It is essential to keep this in mind when analyzing crime data.

The notes also discuss the importance of understanding the difference between trust and scrutiny models in cyber-enabled crimes. The project focuses on residential burglary, which can be tackled in three ways: getting to the scene quickly, detective work after the fact (e.g., CCTV), and preventative measures such as making it an undesirable environment.

The notes mention the use of wards and LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Areas) in Barnett to map crime data accurately. Wards are administrative, while LSOA is more granular, capturing roughly the same number of households or people. The project uses LSOA data to identify burglary hotspots and allocate police resources accordingly.

The project also discusses MOPAC (Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime) data, which provides additional information on judicial outcomes. Police officers can access real-time data on crimes, including the crime profile for the last seven or fourteen days, weather, daylight, holidays, and work schedules, to plan patrols effectively.

The notes mention that police stop and search is ethically debatable, and good projects should be able to present their findings in a manner understandable to anyone without losing information.
